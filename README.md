# XRP-Monitor
Monitor Crypto in real time through a Discord bot.
I originally made this for my private Discord to track my XRP investment, but lost interest in doing anything more with it. I don't image it has much use to anyone apart from myself, but it's here if you really want to use it lol. Has support for changing currency to anything on CoinBase, and settings are server specific (If that's of any use to anyone lol). Enjoy this meme.


There's poor limiations like only supporting 1 currency per instance per server. But I originally made this for a pretty specific use case


Oh, and it uses [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia).
